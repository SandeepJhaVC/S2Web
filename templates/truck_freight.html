<h3>TRUCK LOAD FREIGHT</h3>
                Our TL freight brokerage platform connects shippers with fleet owners and suppliers of truckload capacity across the country through a centralized bidding and matching engine. The platform allows shippers and our teams to post their spot and long-term truckload freight requirements. Registered agents and fleet owners can bid for these jobs using our in-house application, Axle. Loads are matched to capacity based on price and service quality. We also acquired Roadpiper Technologies Private Limited, a digital freight broker with fleet owner, load-matching, and pricing applications, strengthening our capability to engage with suppliers of truckload capacity.
